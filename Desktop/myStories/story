In the same forest there lived a crocodile and his wife.One day crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the trees.
The kind hearted monkey offered him some friuts. The Crocodile came back the next day for more friuts as he loved them.
As the days passed, crocodile and monkey became freinds.
